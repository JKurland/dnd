# Summary #

Phandolin is running low on population due to numerous goblin raids, floods, earthquakes, gnome raids and now dragon attacks. Phandolin is a border town and vital to protecting the city of neverwinter. General William Stirling-Lewis has sent his disappointment of a son, Arthur stirling-lewis to help "refill the sandbag" by organising a publicity stunt to put phandolin on the map and attract new residents. High command has decided their best option is to hold a glamourous fashion show in the town. Special guests were invited but due to an unforeseen orc raid the special guests have been "delayed" and the townsfolk will need to put the production on themselves.


# Plot #

## Setup ##
The plot starts with the mayor calling the players to a meeting. He will explain how orc attacks have reduced the population of phandolin over the years and then introduce Arthur stirling-lewis who will explain the disaster of the lost guests and asks the players to enter the show but to try to keep the lost guests a secret. Arthur promises the players a reward if they do well.

To celebrate the occasion the town has put on a fete. This could be a good place to try to find materials.

When the players are ready they should go to the inn which will be the venue for the show.

## Fete ##

One stall is a jam making contest where first prize is a special piece of material that was recovered (by Fuck) from the wreckage of the "delayed" caravan the special guests were traveling in. The judge of the contest is Fuck. Obviously any normal jam will not satisfy Fuck so if the players bring something sufficiently meaty they will win the prize.

The special cloth is in fact sentient and will scream when someone tries to cut it. Instead the cloth will transform into any garment the wearer wants. The cloth does not like being worn because humans have disgusting bodies. Whoever has the cloth gets +5 to all fashion rolls.


## Show ##
After all the players have created their costumes they can go to the inn. The inn will be set up with magical broadcast equipment for the city to watch the show happen, there is also an audience present live. 

Each player will take their turn deciding what to do on the cat walk, I will give advantage to players who come up with something interesting or players who have done well creating their costumes. Players will roll performance, good rolls will make the crowd happier.

After each player has had a go orcs will attack the inn and this is where we'll stop.
