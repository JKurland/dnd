# Summary #

Phandolin is running low on population due to numerous goblin raids, floods, earthquakes, gnome raids and now dragon attacks. A phandolin is a border town and vital to protecting the heart of the empire General William Stirling-Lewis has sent his disappointment of a son, Arthur stirling-lewis to help "refill the sandbag" by organising a publicity stunt to put phandolin on the map and attract new residents. High command has decided their best option is to hold a glamourous fashion show in the town. Special guests were invited but due to an unforeseen goblin raid the special guests have been "delayed" and the townsfolk will need to put the production on themselves.


# Plot #
The plot starts with the mayor announcing the upcoming festivities to the town. He will then introduce Arthur stirling-lewis who will explain the disaster of the lost guests and will pick the players from the crowd and order them to enter the show. He will then pick the haunted house on the hill as the venue. At this point a villager in the crowd will object, saying that house is haunted but Stirling-Lewis will just ignore the objection. Stirling-Lewis will order the bartender to distribute materials.

Some materials have been provided and will be distributed by the bartender. When emily tries to get materials she will be rejected due to her outstanding debt to the bartender.

To celebrate the occasion the town is holding a jam making contest where first prize is a special piece of material that was recovered (by Fuck) from the wreckage of the "delayed" caravan the special guests were traveling in. The judge of the contest is Fuck who is fulfilling his community service. His crime was causing a public health scare after some of the contents of his jacket spilt into the town well. Fuck told the sentencing committee about his love of cooking and food and so was given this job. Obviously any normal jam will not satisfy Fuck but whichever player brings the meatiest thing will win. If no-one does Fuck will just take the prize himself.

The special cloth is in fact sentient and will scream when someone tries to cut it. Instead the cloth will transform into any garment the wearer wants. The cloth does not like being worn because humans have disgusting bodies. Whoever has the cloth gets +5 to all fashion rolls.

After all the players have created their costumes they can go to the haunted house. The house will be set up with magical broadcast equipment for the empire to watch the show happen, the equipment also allows a large "studio" audience to be heard to provide feedback to the players. Each player will take their turn deciding what to do on the cat walk, I will give advantage to players who come up with something interesting or players who have done well creating their costumes. Players will roll performance and at the end the total sum of the performance checks will decide how well the show went. With a bigger gold prize if it went well (what kind of threshold would be good here?).

After all the players have had a go ghosts will overrun the show and the players will probably need to run away.
